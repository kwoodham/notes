       Discussed with elders on 2/19 - decided that this would best be handed off to Kirk.  I need to set
   up a meeting with Kirk - need to understand from Ed what direction was given to brothers household regarding Brian.

       I talked with Brian yesterday - seemed to be more contrite - having good quiet times, feels bad that he doesn't have a church to go to.  Need to work with someone on SouthSide to reengage.  Promised a response by 2/18
